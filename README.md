WeatherPy
Linear Relationships with Latitude:
The linear relationship between latitude and max temperature is strong; the higher the temperatures are. This works for both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The linear relationship between latitude and humidity is weak, almost non existant.

The linear relationship between latitude and cloudiness is very weak.

The linear relationship between latitude and wind speed is also very weak.

VacationPy
The maps provide information using the data file created in WeatherPy to find the closest hotels in specfic cities in coorelation with the temperature, windspeed and cloudiness. This allows us to see the ideal hotel location.
